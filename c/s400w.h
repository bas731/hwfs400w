 * Created 2014-11-22 by bastel.
 *
 * Implements a low level interface to the Mustek(tm) S400W iScanAir(R) scanner.
 *
 * This is a clean room implementation based on written down specs (see commands.txt)
 * and does not contain any code by mustek. Using simple c and non blocking I/O,
 * it's easy to understand, clean and easily portable to other programming languages.
 * It is not thread safe, but only needs a little ram (around 64k kiB for scanning).
 *
 * Scanner related methods usually return a byte array containing the scanner's response. Please be aware
 * that the response array is not a copy and not constant for unknown responses but will be altered on the next
 * call to any scanner related method. Do not store it 'for later'.
 * Returned known responses are mapped to their static equivalent and can be stored and compared with <code>==</code>.
